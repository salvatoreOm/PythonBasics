# we can use .lower() and .upper() and islower() and isupper() for cases in string
# for length we use len(string name) and for grabbing characters we can use the string by indexed as s[0]
#  .index("G") gives the index of G
#  you can also use .replace("","") func for replacing the whole string by any other string

# For numbers we can use many different functions such as
#  abs() which gives the absolute of a number and pow(1,2) gives 1 raised to 2
#   max(1,2) an min(1,2) are some basic functions
# some other functions are round() and floor() and ceil() and sqrt()
# input("prompt") for input

#Lists
#friends = [1,2,3] can be any data type of lists you can access the list by starting from [0] or by [-1]
# use print(:) for range in lists
